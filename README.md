JEAS – Job and Employment Assistance Services App

JEAS is a mobile application developed as a graduation project at the University of Jordan from March 2024 to July 2024. The app aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and service providers through an easy-to-use, lightweight digital platform inspired by the Uber model.

Introduction

In today’s fast-changing world, the labor market continuously evolves due to technological advancements. JEAS addresses the growing need for effective platforms that connect job seekers with employment opportunities and service providers with clients.

Project Motivation

Many job seekers face challenges finding opportunities that match their qualifications, while service providers struggle to reach clients. This app aims to:

Simplify job and service discovery

Create a digital marketplace that supports income generation and access to services

Help users find local work-from-home jobs and on-demand services easily
